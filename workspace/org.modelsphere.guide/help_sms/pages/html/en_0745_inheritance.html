<b>Inheritance is the mechanism by which more specific elements incorporate the structure
and behavior of more general elements related by behavior. The number of
inheritance relationships for a class is not restricted.</b><br><br>
In <b>Open ModelSphere</b>, the inheritance is a relationship between two classes.
It does not have any design properties. However, the class’ properties window will
display direct superclasses and subclasses information.<br><br>
To indicate inheritance between classes:<ol>
<li>Locate the <b>Inheritance Creation tool</b> <img src="../images/angulararrowlineend.gif"> in the Java creation toolbar
and click the tool twice. If you click a tool twice, you indicate that you want
to use it several times consecutively.<br><br></li>
<li>Select the first class, then a second class. An arrow indicating inheritance
joins the two classes. You can repeat the operation as many times as you
wish.<br><br></li>
</ol>
Your diagram should resemble the following illustration.

<li><b>Inheritance Creation Tool</b>: creates an inheritance relationship between two
classes directly in a diagram and adds its graphical representation. Important
note: If an inheritance relationship already exists between two classes
(as displayed in the class property window), only the graphical representation
will be added.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Link From Class Property Window</b>: Link to the superclass from the class
property window without creating any graphical representation.<br><br></li>
