<b>
Multiplicity is the specification of the range of allowable cardinality that
a set can assume. Multiplicity specifications can be given to roles within
relationships, parts with composites, repetitions and other purposes.
Essentially, a multiplicity is a (possibly infinite) subset of the positive
integers.</b><br><br>
When a relationship is created, default multiplicities 0,N and 1,1 are attributed to
the source and target entities respectively. However, it is possible to change the multiplicity
factor in the relationship.<ol>
<li>Place the pointer tool on the <b>role (or relationship) descriptor label</b> and <b>right-click</b>
it.</li>
<li>Select <b>Multiplicity</b> from the <b>pop-up menu</b> and then the desired cardinality.</li>
</ol>

You can also change a relationship’s multiplicity from the <b>design panel</b>.
Left-click the <b>role (or relationship) descriptor label</b> and edit the <b>multiplicity</b> line.
