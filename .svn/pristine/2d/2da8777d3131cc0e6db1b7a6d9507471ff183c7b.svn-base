<b>An association represents a relationship between at most two
tables. Depending on the associations’ multiplicity, a table will be designated
either as parent or as child.</b><br><br>
<b>Open ModelSphere</b> offers two types of associations: the <b>right-angle</b> <img src="../images/associationrightangle.gif">
and the <b>free angle</b> <img src="../images/association.gif"> associations. Both play exactly the same role, only their
appearance is different.<br><ol>
<li>Right-click the association creation tool.<br><br></li>
<li>Select one of the associations displayed in the ModelSphere toolbar. (While
you can use any of the associations, for the purposes of this example,
choose the angular line association).<br><br></li>
<li>Click somewhere in the middle of the source table, then, in the middle of
the target table.<br><br></li>
<li>Add the associations as depicted in the following example.<br><br></li>

<b>If you create a recursive association and manually bring every point to
the center point of the table, you will graphically lose the association.</b> To
