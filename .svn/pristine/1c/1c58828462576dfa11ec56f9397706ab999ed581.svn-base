<b>
Multiplicity is the specification of the range of allowable cardinality that
a set can assume. Multiplicity specifications can be given to roles within
associations, parts with composites, repetitions and other purposes.
Essentially, a multiplicity is a (possible infinite) subset of the positive
integers.</b><br><br>
When an association is created, default multiplicities 0,N and 1,1 are attributed to
the source and target tables respectively. However, it is possible to change the multiplicity
factor in the association.<ol>
<li>Place the pointer tool on the <b>role (or association) descriptor label</b> and <b>right-click</b>
it.</li>
<li>Select <b>Multiplicity</b> from the <b>pop-up menu</b> and then the desired cardinality.</li>
</ol>

You can also change an association’s multiplicity from the <b>design panel</b>.
Left-click the <b>role (or association) descriptor label</b> and edit the <b>multiplicity</b> line.
