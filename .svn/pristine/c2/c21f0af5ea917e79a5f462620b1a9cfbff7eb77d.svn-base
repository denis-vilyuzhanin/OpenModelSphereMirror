<b>The Find feature allows you to find objects in the explorer window based
on various criteria and options.</b><br><br>
The search mechanism is based on regular expressions (grep see below for explanation).
Also, objects to find and selected options and scope that you previously
looked for will be kept in memory during the current session.<br><br>
To use this feature, select <b>Edit > Find</b> from the <b>main menu</b>.
Or click the <b>Find tool</b> <img src="../images/find.gif"> located in the <b>Edit toolbar</b>. The following window will
appear.

<font face="sans serif,arial,helvetica" color="000000" size="4"><b>Options</b></font><ul>
<li><b>Case sensitive</b>: matches the exact case of the object string. (ex: MiX oF BoTh CaSeS)<br><br></li>
<li><b>Whole words only</b>: matches the exact string only.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Regular expressions (grep)</b>: includes grep replacement characters.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Recursive</b>: searches in every model below, including data submodel, the selection in a recursive way.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<b>Note: A regular expression consists of a character string where some characters
are given special meaning with regards to pattern matching. grep
allows the string argument to be specified as a regular expression, which
is a way of specifying a string that allows certain metacharacters (special
keyboard characters such as the period) to stand for other characters
or to further define the way the pattern matching should work.</b>

<br><br><br>
<font face="sans serif,arial,helvetica" color="000000" size="4"><b>Scope</b></font><ul>
<li><b>Name</b>: compares the object to find with the object’s name.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Physical name</b>: compares the object to find with the object’s physical name.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Alias</b>: compares the object to find with the object’s alias.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Description</b>: compares the object to find with the object’s description.<br><br></li>
<li><b>All other text fields</b>: compares the object to find with all other objects’ string
attributes including multi-line properties (i.e. procedure’s body).<br><br></li>
</ul>
<b>If you wish to narrow your search down, perform it at the model level instead
of the project level.</b>
